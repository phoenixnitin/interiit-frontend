          The Inter IIT Sports Meet is the annual sports tournament of the Indian Institutes of Technology. It is organized in December every year, with the Aquatics events held separately in October. The seven old IITs - IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee and IIT Guwahati - take turns hosting the event. Inter IIT Sports Meet (or just Inter IIT, as students of the IITs call it) is the one of the rare events  wherein all the IITs participate.
        </p>
        <p>Tournaments are held in 13 different sports, namely: Athletics,
Badminton,
Basketball,
Cricket,
Football,
Hockey,
Lawn Tennis,
Squash,
Swimming,
Table Tennis,
Volleyball,
Water Polo,
  Weightlifting</p>
<p>
  As the Inter-IIT Rule Book notes, the main objective of Inter IIT Sports Meet is “to organize sports competitions in some selected Olympics-recognized events, to encourage sportsmanship, to promote and create a better harmony, understanding and friendly interaction among the students of the IITs as well as to foster a close association among them”</p>

        <p>It also goes on add, “to make students aware of the importance of sports and games in a modern era, to help students perform skillfully in all life situations and also raise the standard of sports in IIT’s.”</p>

        <h1 class="all-heading">A Brief History</h1>

<p>The proposition for an Inter IIT Sports Meet was brought up in 1961, and IIT Bombay hosted the first ever Inter IIT Sports Meet. Only five IITs were in existence then, namely IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Kanpur and IIT Delhi; who competed in five sports only.</p>

<p>The Meet in 1971 was cancelled due to the India-Pakistan war, while the one in 1992 was to be held at IIT Bombay but was cancelled owing to the communal riots in Mumbai. The 2015 meet that was supposed to be held at IIT Madras was washed out due to unpredictable rains.</p>

<p>This year - in 2017 - however, Madras has once again been bestowed with the honour of hosting this nationwide sports tournament. IIT Madras has won the general championship 9 times back to back from 1972 to1980, which is the longest winning streak in the history of the Meet. Madras has also won the championship a whopping  total of 22 times out of the 51 editions held previously.</p>

<p>IIT Kanpur has been winning the GC for the past 3 editions of the Meet. It is yet to be seen, however, if the streak will continue or if a new champion will emerge. It will all boil down to the moment of truth. 1st to 4th October and 15th to 23rd December - catch the action at Madras!</p>
